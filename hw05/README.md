1) put my own project onto the Project page called Beaglebone dolphin emulator console
2) did the make file exercise
3) installed kernel
4) cross-compiled
5) P1, P2, and P3 (exercise 1) done for kernel modules. Also adjusted gpio_test.c
to turn on an LED at gpio51 due to a button at gpio48.

Which kernel are you running?
